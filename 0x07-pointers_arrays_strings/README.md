# Even more Pointers, Arrays and Strings in C

This directory contains projects on:
1. Pointer to pointer
2. Multi-dimensional array

The use of standard library is not allowed. A special function in _putchar is used to print to stdout.

_Codes follow the Betty style.

All functions prototype are in `main.h`
